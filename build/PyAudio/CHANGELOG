  PyAudio 0.2.3

  - Release the GIL during blocking PortAudio I/O calls.

  - Fixed Python argument parsing to use a long for PaSampleFormat
    (rather than int).

    Thanks to many who have pointed out these two issues and sent
    patches.

  - pyaudio.PyAudio.is_format_supported() now throws a ValueError
    exception if the specified format is not supported for any reason
    (or returns True if the format is supported).

    Prior, the method would return False if and only if the specified
    sample rate was unsupported. is_format_supported() now will always
    return True or throw an exception.
